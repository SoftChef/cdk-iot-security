# Fleet-Provision Construct Demonstration: Regular Mode

The Fleet-Provision flow mainly consist of two parts, one is about the service provider, the other is about the client. The service provider deploy the Fleet-Provision construct providing funcionalities of creating Fleet-Provisioning template and provision claim certificate. Then, the service provider create Fleet-Provisioning template and provision claim certificate, and place the provision claim certificate in the device. The client get the device and connect the device to the AWS IoT with the provision claim certificate. The device requests to generate and registers the device certificate, eventually receives the formal device certificate which allows the device to access the provisioned resources. In the following sections, we lead you through the basic example step-by-step, and leave some design advices.


## Service Provider Side

### Deploy the Construct

First of all, the service provide should deploy the construct to setup the Fleet-Provision functionalities. Clone the project and build the codes.

    git clone https://github.com/SoftChef/cdk-iot-security.git
    cd cdk-iot-security
    yarn add projen
    npx projen build

Deploy the Fleet-Provision construct with demo file. One AWS lambda functions, Fleet Generator, will be deployed for further use.
    
    cdk deploy --app 'node lib/demo/fleet-provision/regular-mode/deploy'

After deploying the construct, an URL returned from the console as this format: ```https://<prefix>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/```. In the following steps, we will use this URL to access the API.

### Create the Fleet-Provisioning Template and the Provisioning Claim Certificate

Call the API with the following command. 

    curl -X POST -d '{"templateName":"<templateName>"}' https://<prefix>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/fleetGenerator > fleet.json

The API will invoke the Fleet Generator and return the information, including ID, ARN, keys, and certificate, of the provisioning claim certificate registered on AWS IoT. In the file ```fleet.json```, there is a template ARN. Remember the ARN for late use.

Go to the AWS Cloud Formation Console. Select the stack **FleetProvisionDemo** and find the S3 Bucket under the Resources section. Go to that S3 bucket and find the folder with the name same as the template ARN. Download files ```provision_claim.cert.pem```, ```provision_claim.private_key.pem```, and ```provision-claim-certificate.json``` from that folder. Place these downloaded files under path ```src/demo/fleet-provision/regular-mode/certs```.

## Client Side

### Connect the Device with AWS IoT

The AWS IoT Root Certificate is neccessary for the connection. Run this command to download it.

    curl https://www.amazontrust.com/repository/AmazonRootCA1.pem > src/demo/fleet-provision/regular-mode/certs/root_ca.cert.pem

Fill up the template name, thing name, and AWS IoT Data-ATS endpoint in ```settings.json```. You can check the endpoint with the following command.

    aws iot describe-endpoint --endpoint-type iot:Data-ATS

Finally, the script ```connect.js``` use the certificate to connect to the AWS IoT through.

    node src/demo/fleet-provision/regular-mode/connect.js

A Certificate, a Thing, and an IoT Policy are set on the AWS IoT. Moreover, the device certificate and private key are returned from the AWS IoT and write in the files under path ```./certs```. They can be used by a device for further interaction with AWS IoT.
